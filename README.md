# Mellybean Fan Club

This was my first multi-page website, and can be found live at [Mellybean Fan Club](https://www.mellybean.club)

All the animation was done with css and the AOS library.

I was learning React in parallel to building this site, and experimented by using it to build the flip and match game portion found [here](https://www.mellybean.club/matching-game)
