            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
              <span>Melly loves to play games.</span> All her feline friends
              want to do, though, is take a nap. So when she doesn't leave them
              alone, the cats trick her into burying a shoe in the backyard. But
              the small prank turns into a big problem when Melly falls down the
              hole . . . and is magically transports her to another world!
            </p>

            <p>
              Melly lands smack-dab in the middle of a scuffle between a group
              of knights and a huge monster. But Melly soon befriends the grumpy
              giant, learning he isn't as scary as he seems. He's being hunted
              by a greedy king. One who has also been stealing from his people
              and locking them up in the dungeons. So although Melly is
              desperate to find a way back home to Mama and Papa (her human
              owners), she makes it her mission to help her new friend and the
              kingdom. But how could someone so tiny defeat such a powerful
              king? It may just take a game that only Melly can win.

            </h3>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter1"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 1: The Forbidden Game</h3>
            <p>
              Melly chases Butternut around the house trying to get him to play
              with her. Butternut leads Melly to the couch where Chuck and Tugs
              are napping and the naughty kitties trick Melly into playing
              "hide-the-shoe". Tugs leads Melly outside and quickly slams the
              door shut behind her. With Melly gone, the kitties resume napping.
              Melly digs a hole for the shoe and finds that the hole connects to
              a hollow that seems bottomless. The ground crumbles and Melly
              falls... and falls...
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter2"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 2: The Giant Monster</h3>
            <p>
              Melly's landing is unusual. She "pop"s into a soft landing and
              tumbles to safety. Voices are heard in the distance and Melly
              witnesses soldiers attacking a giant monster. The soldiers are no
              match for the monster who quickly thwarts their attacks and sends
              them running in fear. The monster then turns to Melly and lets out
              a giant "RAWR" but Melly fearlessly smiles and licks the monster's
              nose. The monster is annoyed and walks away.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter3"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 3: A Persistent Pup</h3>
            <p>
              Melly follows the monster and introduces herself, but the monster
              is not interested in making friends. In an effort to get rid of
              Melly the monster agrees to play "fetch" and launches a stick
              across the landscape - only to be amazed when Melly returns with
              the stick in no time. The monster warns Melly that she should stay
              away from him or she might also be hunted by humans too, but Melly
              explains all the humans she knows are really nice. The monster
              tell a story of his best human friend who betrayed him. The story
              is of a wizard named Wilma who seemed to be a loyal friend until
              one day she stole his tail and with it, his magical powers. The
              soldiers show up again and we learn they are after the monster's
              "gold" which is actually the monster's eye boogies. Back at home,
              the cats suddenly realize with Melly gone they can get into some
              hilarious mischief. That quickly comes to an end with the
              realization that if Melly is lost, they'll be in big trouble.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter4"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 4: The Bad King</h3>
            <p>
              The chapter opens with the king in a room full of gold, bragging
              about how great he is at everything while a sculptor works in the
              background, chiseling another statue of him. The king's advisor
              storms in to inform him that there is no more gold in the castle
              mines. This infuriates the king who threatens the mine workers
              with punishment if they don't produce more gold. The king mentions
              his plan to capture the monster so he can have an endless amount
              of gold. The king's advisor then informs the king that the people
              of the city cannot pay their taxes and a local orphanage
              Headmistress has been arrested for this crime. The king commands
              she be put in the dungeon with the others. The king hands a page
              from a book of ancient creatures that contains an image of the
              monster to the sculptor and orders him to begin an epic painting
              of the king single handedly capturing the monster.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter5"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 5: The Good People</h3>
            <p>
              Back in the forest, Melly is still following the monster around.
              Melly insists they're "friends" now, but the monster isn't
              interested. Melly asks the monster to help her find her way home
              and invites the monster to come and live with her, the cats and
              "Mama" and "Papa". Just as Melly is trying to convince the monster
              that not all humans are bad, voices are heard shouting "ATTACK!!".
              This time, it's not the soldiers, but three children from the
              orphanage, Leah, Liam and Lou. Melly introduces herself and we
              learn the monster's name, Narra. The children are amazed at how
              Narra defeats a handful of soldiers who suddenly appear, and they
              beg Narra to help them rescue Ms. Cooper, the orphanage
              Headmistress who is being kept in the king's dungeon. Narra
              watches as the children rescue an injured bird and is convinced
              that good people do exist. Melly suggests they head over to the
              castle and try sitting nicely to get the king to release Ms.
              Cooper, because according to Melly, humans LOVE a good sit.
              Meanwhile, back at home the cats are working on a plan to rescue
              Melly using a leash and harness.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter6"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 6: A Good Sit</h3>
            <p>
              Melly and the children ride up to the castle gates on Narra's
              head. The people of the city are terrified, but Leah shouts down
              to them and explains Narra is friendly. The king is told that they
              would like to speak to him and he assumes they want to surrender.
              Melly, Narra and the children sit in unison and the king bursts
              out in laughter. Melly tells the king they want him to stop
              hunting Narra and release Ms. Cooper, but the king laughs that off
              too. Melly then challenges the king to a race around the perimeter
              of the castle and the King cannot refuse a good challenge. If
              Melly wins, the king must leave Narra alone, give up the crown and
              release Ms. Cooper. If the king wins, Narra will be his
              prisoner... FOREVER.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter7"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 7: The Big Race</h3>
            <p>
              The cats are trying to decide who will be the unlucky one to be
              lowered into the hole for the rescue mission. Tugs is too heavy so
              Butternut and Chuck play rock, paper, scissors to decide.
              Butternut loses and is handed the harness. Back at the castle
              gates, Melly and the king take their marks and ready themselves
              for the race. Leah waves the flag and shouts "GO!", the race
              begins and Melly zooms off effortlessly while the king immediately
              looks tired. The king huffs and puffs for a bit but quickly sneaks
              off into a mine entrance looking for a shortcut. The mines are
              dark with lots of turns and it seems the king is in a bit of
              trouble. Melly zips around the castle and crosses the finish line,
              applauded by her friends and the crowd. The king's advisor orders
              the soldiers to arrest Melly, but the soldiers swear their loyalty
              to Melly who won the crown fair and square.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter8"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 8: Gifts From Above</h3>
            <p>
              King Melly immediately orders all the prisoners to be released
              from the dungeons and that Narra is to be never hunted again.
              Next, Melly and the children hop on Narra and fly over to the
              king's chamber. Narra smashes it open and scoops up the hoarded
              riches. Together, they fly over the city and shower the happy
              crowd with gold and riches while the king stumbles around in the
              darkness of the mines, still lost. The children are finally
              reunited with Ms. Cooper and Melly tells them it's time she finds
              her way back home to Mama and Papa. Melly asks Narra to be king
              and just as he accepts, Butternut pops out of Narra's nostril,
              hanging from the leash. Narra digs around in his nose and pulls
              out a magic portal and sets it in the king's chamber so Melly can
              use it to come back any time. Narra appoints Liam, Leah, Lou and
              Ms. Cooper as Royal Advisors to help him rule the kingdom and a
              warm goodbye is exchanged before Melly and Butternut jump into the
              portal and journey home.

            <h3>Chapter 9: None The Wiser.</h3>
            <p>
              Melly and Butternut tumble through the portal and pop out of the
              hole where Tugs and Chuck are pulling the leash. They share their
              excitement that Melly is home safe and no one will get in trouble.
              Melly tells them she's too tired to tell them about her adventure
              at the moment and calls for a well deserved nap. The adorable hero
              calls dibs on the sunbeam and they rush off to the couch together.

                When the king hands the sculptor a page from the book of ancient
                creatures, there is an illustration of Narra next to another
                creature. That creature is Hetty, a hippocorn who is a character
                in book 2, Mellybean and the Wicked Wizard.
