            <p>
              <span>Melly's learned a new trick,</span> and she can't wait to
              show the cats. But when they all head outside to play, Melly
              accidentally loses her ball down the magical hole in their
              backyard. So she decides this is the perfect excuse to visit her
              friends in the fantastical world on the other side. And this time
              around, the cats want to come too. (After all, they need to find
              someone to open their cans of food!)
            </p>

            <p>
              But instead of a warm welcome, the group discovers the whole
              kingdom has fallen into a mysterious deep sleep. And it is all
              thanks to Wilma, the wizard who long ago took Narra's powers.
              She's back to finish what she started by stealing the magic of
              other mythical creatures so she can become the greatest wizard
              ever. Now Melly and the cats are all that stand in her way. But
              how will these four ordinary pets stop an extraordinary villain?
              Well, they may just have a few tricks up their sleeves!

            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter1"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 1: A New Start</h3>
            <p>
              Narra lets out a huge yawn and adds his eye crust to a huge pile
              of gold. Ms. Cooper, Leah, Liam and Lou report to Narra on how the
              city is thriving under his rule and Ms. Cooper informs Narra that
              his "friends from the old days" are here to visit. Narra's
              friends, a minotaur, a centaur and a fawn thank him for uniting
              the kingdom.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter2"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 2: Tricks Or Treats</h3>
            <p>
              Back at Melly's house, the cats are busy with various silly
              activities and Melly is looking for someone to help her practice
              her new trick - catch. With everyone too busy to play, Melly
              wanders off into the backyard. Meanwhile, in a place not far from
              Narra's kingdom, a cute "Hippocorn" who is on her way to see Narra
              gets distracted by a basket of cheesy buns. She stops to eat one
              and immediately her wings pop off and she falls to the ground.
              Wilma, the wicked wizard is waiting there and snatches up the
              wings, giving her the power to "control the air". Wilma reveals
              her plan to collect powers from all the ancient creatures. Wilma
              tries on the wings and uses her new power to lift her tower home
              into the air.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter3"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 3: Ungrounded</h3>
            <p>
              The cats follow Melly out to the yard and begin a game of Keep
              Away with Melly's ball. The ball falls down the hole in the yard
              and Melly suggests they all go down together since a visit to
              Narra's kingdom is overdue. The cats agree and the four of them
              journey down the hole with a wagon full of cat food. Meanwhile,
              Wilma has been busy experimenting with her new powers. She has now
              learned to use Narra's tail magic, the "power of life itself" and
              is making all kinds of things come to life, including objects
              around her tower. Wilma reveals her plan to steal power from a
              Dragonseal and a Griffenbear next, to complete her suite of
              magical powers. Back in Narra's kingdom, just as people were
              enjoying a large social gathering at the palace, something strange
              starts to happen. Narra and guests start to feel weak and collapse
              to the floor. Narra says it feels like "something is draining the
              world of its energy".
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter4"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 4: Adventure Time</h3>
            <p>
              Melly and the cats burst out of the portal and into the palace to
              find everyone, including Narra, laying on the floor unconscious.
              The cats think a group nap is a great idea, but Narra awakens
              slightly and tells Melly something is terribly wrong. He tells
              Melly that Wilma must be abusing the power of life and that Melly
              has to stop her or all will be lost in the kingdom. Just then, the
              Hippocorn arrives at the palace and introduces herself to Melly
              and the cats. Her name is Hetty, and she explains she and Narra
              are guardians of Ado, the world they're in. Along with the
              Griffenbear and Dragonseal, Hetty and Narra control the four
              elements, earth, water, air and life. Hetty, Melly and the cats
              agree to stop Wilma and the five of them bounce their way out of
              the castle with our heroes riding on Hetty's back.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter5"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 5: Grand Plans</h3>
            <p>
              Wilma is in her tower wearing Hetty's wings and Narra's tail,
              surrounded by objects that she brought to life to do her chores.
              Outside, below the tower, Melly, Hetty and the cats think of a way
              to get up inside. They use a tree to catapult themselves up
              through the window, but that leaves Hetty stuck below. Inside,
              Wilma is surprised by their entrance and is delighted by their
              cuteness. However, Melly tells her they are there to put a stop to
              her stealing magical powers and take back the ones she already
              stole. Wilma laughs at them and quickly begins using her power to
              control objects in the room to fight them off.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter6"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 6: Tower Defense</h3>
            <p>
              Outside, Hetty uses a boulder to catapult herself up to the tower.
              She gets stuck head first in the window and sees Melly and the
              cats being chased around by various objects that have come to
              life. Wilma decides to summon a wind powerful enough to blow them
              all to the other side of the world. As Wilma begins gathering
              strength, Chuck suggests that Butternut grab the wings off of
              Wilma's back. Butternut climbs up a bookshelf and hops on Wilma's
              back, but the wings are stuck. Hetty tells Butternut to use the
              magic "procuring powder" that Wilma uses to steal powers with but
              Wilma is holding it in the air, out of reach. Chuck and Tugs hop
              onto Wilma's feet and and drag her down while Butternut bats it
              out of her hand. The little jar of power flies through the air and
              Melly leaps up and catches it in mid-air! Practicing her new trick
              paid off, Melly sprinkles the powder on Wilma and Hetty's wings
              and Narra's tail immediately pop off. Unfortunately, with Wilma's
              powers gone, the floating tower begins to fall to the ground.
              Melly grabs Narra's tail, Butternut grabs the wings and the heroes
              leap through the window just as Wilma gathers up her wizard magic
              and lets out a giant blast aimed at them, causing an explosion.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter7"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 7: Bad Air Day</h3>
            <p>
              The tower explodes and Melly and the gang are left screaming and
              falling helplessly. Hetty manages to put her wings on and use her
              power to catch everyone, including Wilma before they hit the
              ground. Wilma isn't going down without a fight. She again gathers
              up her magic, forms a fireball and launches it at Hetty. Hetty
              easily snuffs out the attack with her power and captures Wilma in
              a floating bubble. Melly suggest they head back to the palace to
              give Narra his tail back.
            </p>
            <a class="anchor chapter_sum" id="chapter8"></a>
            <h3>Chapter 8: Whole Again</h3>
            <p>
              At the palace, Narra and the guests are beginning to slowly wake
              up. Melly and the gang arrive and give Narra his tail and
              immediately life is restored around the kingdom. Narra sprinkles
              what is left of the powder on Wilma and she loses what is left of
              her wizard magic. Wilma is heartbroken that she is now powerless
              but the cats assure her that she still has the power to... open
              cans! Wilma is appointed the role of Royal Can-Opener and the cats
              enjoy a meal. Finally, Melly asks if her friends would like to see
              a trick she's been practicing and Chuck tosses Melly's ball into
              the air. Melly leaps into the air and triumphantly catches the
              ball.
